{ "lyrics": "Virginia Woolf and poetry\nNo one seemed to notice me\nBeing young was getting so old\n\nCheap beer and cigarettes\nLife was like a movie set\nAnd I seemed to be given no role\n\nBut in times of trouble\nI can turn to my mother\nAnd I know that she gon' understand\n\nSo at age 18\nI cried to my mother\nAnd she told me, \"young man\"\n\"There are moments when you fall to the ground\nBut you are stronger than you feel you are now\nYou don't always have to speak so loud, no\nJust be as you are\nLife is not always a comfortable ride\nEverybody's got scars that they hide\nAnd everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah\nJust be as you are\"\n\nThey played me on the radio\nAnd everything was changing, so\nI thought I was all the way grown\n\nBut I can still remember in that cold November\nWhen I realized I'm all alone\n\nBut in times of trouble\nI can turn to my mother\nAnd I know that she gon' understand\n\nSo at age 22\nI cried to my mother\nAnd she told me, \"young man\"\n\"There are moments when you fall to the ground\nBut you are stronger than you feel you are now\nYou don't always have to speak so loud, no\nJust be as you are\nIt doesn't matter if you become some star\nLife is better when you open your heart\nYou don't always have to act so hard, no\nJust be as you are\"\n\nIf I'm speaking truthfully\nI'm not who I used to be\nAnd I know some people might laugh\n\nCause my music doesn't sound the same\nAnd my head's no longer shaved\nI'm worried if I'm on the right path\n\nBut in times of trouble\nI can turn to my mother\nAnd I know that she gon' understand\n\nSo at age 26\nI spoke to my mother\nAnd she told me, \"young man\"\n\"There are moments when you fall to the ground\nBut you are stronger than you feel you are now\nYou don't always have to speak so loud, no\nJust be as you are\nIt doesn't matter if you become some star\nLife is better when you open your heart\nYou don't always have to act so hard, no\nJust be as you are\"\n\nBe as you are" }
